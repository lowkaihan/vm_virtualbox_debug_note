1. Ubuntu installation freezes in new VM
Increase RAM:
General -> System -> Motherboard -> increase Base Memory (preferrably increase to 8GB or more)
Increase processor core:
General -> System -> Processor -> increase processors (preferrably increase to 4 cores or more)
Then try install Ubuntu again.
